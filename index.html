<p>The Protein Similarity Networks (PSN) method is a powerful tool for identifying communities in networks whose links depending on the similarity of proteins. Its original implementation consisted of separated algorithms coded in different programming languages, making it difficult to use. This paper presents SCANNET, a package that integrates all algorithms of the PSN into a unique tool to perform all the steps needed to identify communities in protein networks as a single workflow.</p>

<p>The SCANNET software was subjected to validation using case studies with data from enzymes involved in the chitin metabolic pathway: chitin synthase (EC 2.1.4.16), UDP-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.23), and acetylglucosamine phosphate deacetylase (EC 3.5.1.25). By using SCANNET, the user can implement a single workflow and be capable of identifying correctly the communities in  protein networks containing different sequences of each of those enzymes. SCANNET has correctly generated the protein networks, the dendrograms, and the color representation of the neighborhood matrix for each of the studied case.</p>

<p>The experiments have shown that SCANNET is a simple, efficient, reliable, and intuitive implementation of the PSN method to identify communities in  protein networks. In addition, SCANNET improves the graphical interface used in the PSN, generating critical networks, dendrograms, and color representations of neighborhood matrices that can be viewed in the software itself, offering a friendly interface for the users. The next step of our study will be the application of SCANNET in other research areas, in which the identification of communities in complex networks can help understanding complex systems.</p>
