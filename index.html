<p>The <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131">Protein Similarity Networks (PSN) method</a> is a powerful tool for identifying communities in networks whose links depending on the similarity of proteins. Its original implementation consisted of separated algorithms coded in different programming languages, making it difficult to use. To solve this problem was created the SCANNET, a package that integrates all algorithms of the PSN into a unique tool to perform all the steps needed to identify communities in protein networks as a single workflow.
The experiments have shown that SCANNET is a simple, efficient, reliable, and intuitive implementation of the PSN method to identify communities in  protein networks.</p>
